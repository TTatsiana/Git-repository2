I don't even know the time
When I saw you, baby
When I took my single chance
With my heart and lost it

And you were my then pretty lover
And it was smart to be forgotten
You didn't have any rules
And now I know it ain't this

So long, I don't need nobody
So long, ever since I loved you
So long, I don't need nobody
So long, ever since I loved you

I keep having my same dream
That one day you'll call me
And I take my second chance
With my heart away in it
